# dtmfHandler

This library contains the logic for managing the PhoneDTMF library to decode DTMF with software. 

We had trouble using PhoneDTMF in conjunction with Mozzi and switched to using a hardware DTMF decoder. This code should still work, but it hasn't been used for a while. 

Although we aren't using this right now, I have kept it in the project because I want to try converting it to a FreeRTOS task and see if that works better alongside other program activity.
